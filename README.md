# BabyNames

In this project, I implemented a program that reads 27 csv files. The files have data about baby names that are from 1990 to 2017. Each file has 1000 baby names, their ranks, and the number of babies that have those names for that year. This project was made in BlueJ.

# Data format in the csv file 
Column 1: Baby's rank <br/>
Column 2: Baby boy names <br/>
Column 3: Number of baby boys with that name <br/>
Column 4: Baby girl names <br/>
Column 5: Number of baby girls with that name <br/>

The program also sorts the files by alphabetical order by the baby's names and then prints out all of the data to the terminal.

In the terminal, each column of the data will be display in this format: [babyname] : [rank] : [number of babies with that name]

Near the end of the terminal, two array lists will display the boy and girl baby names that appeared in the files and display the total amount of the boy and girl baby names.
